# openbrow
Opens chrome on a specific webpage. If chrome is running, it will open a new tab on the webpage or it will focus the tab that is already on that webpage.

You can use a Stream Deck to link buttons to open or focus websites, making sure that you will use the existing opened tab if it is available.
